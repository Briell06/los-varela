/* This TypeScript code snippet is exporting an array named `footerLinks` containing objects with
properties `endpoint` and `children`. Each object represents a link in a website footer. The
`endpoint` property holds the URL path for the link, and the `children` property holds the text to
be displayed for that link. This array can be imported and used in other parts of the codebase to
dynamically generate footer links on a webpage. */
